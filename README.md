The app is built to show a list from this API https://tandem2019.web.app/api/community_{page}.json

The app is single-activity app with MVVM architecture.

I used Jetpack Compose and Navigation for the UI,
for the dependency injection I used Hilt,
and for the network calls I used Retrofit and to store the result and the changes from the UI I used Room database
